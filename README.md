# sign-up-form

The purpose of this project is to practice form basics and form validations. Although I didn't use much form validations, I will probably come back to this project after learning some regex to add that. I also don't know how to use a confirm password validation which I would have to learn as well.

A really cool property I learned of is background-attachment which creates this cool scroll effect for the background image. Using background-attachment: fixed adds a dynamic effect for the background which I really like.

This is supposed to be a sign-up form for a imaginary online game called "Spellborne". Therefore, this form is simulated off of other popular online game sign up forms.

Instructions:
1. Enter username, email, password, etc.
2. Toggle checkboxes if desired
3. Press play now to submit information

The form is not connected to any backend, therefore it will not send any information. The form is just a mock form.

Some trouble I had:
- Styling the form elements, specifically the checkbox and text types

Features of this project include:
1. Input of text and checkbox types where a user can input their account information
2. Designed checkbox and text inputs
3. Some form validations with minlength and maxlength
